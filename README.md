# Lead Scoring Case Study

**Problem Statement:**

X Education, an online course provider for industry professionals, generates a substantial volume of leads through various marketing channels. Despite high lead generation, the company faces a conversion rate of only 30%. To optimize sales efforts and boost revenue, X Education seeks to develop a lead scoring model.

**Goal:**

To build a logistic regression model will be constructed to predict the probability of lead conversion. This probability will be transformed into a lead score ranging from 0 to 100. A higher score indicates a higher likelihood of conversion (a "hot" lead), while a lower score signifies a lower probability (a "cold" lead). This model will enable the company to prioritize leads for sales outreach and optimize conversion rates.
